PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Marco du Plessis

<https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0>

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them
as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do
everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe
the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you
may only distribute the software according to Distribution License and
make changes or new works based on the software according to Changes
and New Works License.

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute
copies of the software. Your license to distribute covers distributing
the software with changes and new works permitted by Changes and New
Works License.

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software
from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as
well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with `Required Notice:`
that the licensor provided with the software.

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes
and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers
patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license,
that you would infringe by using the software.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any product
that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of
its affiliates provides using the software.

## Competition

Goods and services compete even when they provide functionality through
different kinds of interfaces or for different technical platforms.
Applications can compete with services, libraries with plugins,
frameworks with development tools, and so on, even if they're written
in different programming languages or for different computer
architectures. Goods and services compete even when provided free of
charge. If you market a product as a practical substitute for the
software or another product, it definitely competes.

## New Products

If you are using the software to provide a product that does not
compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings your product
into competition by providing a new version of the software or another
product using the software, you may continue using versions of the
software available under these terms beforehand to provide your
competing product, but not any later versions.

## Discontinued Products

You may begin using the software to compete with a product or service
that the licensor or any of its affiliates has stopped providing,
unless the licensor includes a plain-text line beginning with
`Licensor Line of Business:` with the software that mentions that line
of business.

## Sales of Business

If the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of business
developing the software or using the software to provide a product,
the buyer can also enforce Noncompete for that product.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These
terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your
licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses
to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the
software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company
makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on
behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any
of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your
licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full
compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past
violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your
licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

AS FAR AS THE LAW ALLOWS, THE SOFTWARE COMES AS IS, WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY OR CONDITION, AND THE LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE USE OR NATURE OF THE
SOFTWARE, UNDER ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM.

## Definitions

the "software" is the software the licensor makes available under
these terms.

A "product" can be a good or service, or a combination of them.

"You" refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.

"Your company" is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind

"Control" means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity,
