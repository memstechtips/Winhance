# Winhance - Windows Enhancement Utility 🚀

**Winhance** is a C# application designed to optimize and customize your Windows experience. From software management to system optimizations and customization, Winhance provides functions to enhance Windows 10 and 11 systems.

**Winhance** features most of the same enhancements as [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) without needing to do a clean install of Windows.

## Requirements 💻
- Windows 11
  - *Tested on Windows 11 24H2*
  - *Most things should work on Windows 10 22H2 but there are some issues like Microsoft Edge (legacy) removal*

## Installation 📥

Download from [winhance.net](https://winhance.net) or the [Releases](https://github.com/memstechtips/Winhance/releases) section of this repository.

### Optimize Screen

#### Windows Security Settings
- [⌛] Improve UAC slider to match all of the available options in Windows. User Account Control seems to be automatically set to "High" if a user has selected a value higher than that in Windows. This is due to Winhance not having all the available UAC options. Issue #166

#### Power Management
- [ ] Improve the power section to detect all power plans on the pc and add indicators next to each power plan in the dropdown menu showing what currently exists
