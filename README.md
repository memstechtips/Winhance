# Winhance - Windows Enhancement Utility 🚀

**Winhance** is a C# application designed to optimize and customize your Windows experience. From software management to system optimizations and customization, Winhance provides functions to enhance Windows 10 and 11 systems.

**Winhance** features most of the same enhancements as [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) without needing to do a clean install of Windows.

## Requirements 💻
- Windows 11
  - *Tested on Windows 11 24H2*
  - *Most things should work on Windows 10 22H2 but there are some issues like Microsoft Edge (legacy) removal*

## Installation 📥

Download from [winhance.net](https://winhance.net) or the [Releases](https://github.com/memstechtips/Winhance/releases) section of this repository.

The `Winhance.Installer.exe` includes an Installable and Portable version during setup.
